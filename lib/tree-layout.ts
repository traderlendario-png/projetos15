 * its SOP tasks are the main limbs, each task's single worker (an agent or a
 * human — monogamous, one per task) sits directly above it, and the tools that
 * worker uses are the leaves in the canopy. Skeleton branches lean at most
 * ~45° off vertical so the joints read as a tree that grew, not a right-angled
 * diagram; the canopy gets a de-overlap sweep so leaves never crowd.
 *
 * Pure + deterministic: no React, no DB. The component feeds these positions to
 * the force simulation as glide targets and draws the branches with `branchPath`.
