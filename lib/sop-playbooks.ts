 * SOP playbooks — the rich breakdown behind each SOP task card in the /brain

 * so it can later be swapped for engine/DB-backed data without touching the card.
 *
 * Each SOP decomposes into sub-skills (BREAKS INTO), stands on upstream work
 * (BUILDS ON), states what it displaces (WHAT IT REPLACES), and carries the
 * autonomy ladder (human-led → human-assisted → fully-autonomous), the human's
 * role, build notes, a runnable skill file, and a build status. Skill file
 * bodies are generated dummy SKILL.md for now (the operator: "dummy data for the
